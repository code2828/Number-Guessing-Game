# Number-Guessing-Game
A simple number guessing game using JFrame. Made to play around with Java. Abandoned. May receive weird updates (or not).

This was my first repo on github. I was only 11 when I uploaded the Initial Commit. It has truly merited its name, being not only the Initial Commit of this repository, but quite the Initial Commit of my programming experience.
